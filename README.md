Unsupervised Music Clustering Based on Audio Features
Problem Statement:
Organizing and exploring massive music libraries has become a challenge. Traditional genre labels are often inconsistent or overly broad, and listeners now tend to explore music based on "vibes" or "moods" rather than genres.

Goal:
The goal is to use an unsupervised learning approach to automatically cluster songs based on their audio characteristics (like danceability, energy, and acousticness) — without using any explicit genre labels — and discover natural groupings in the music.
